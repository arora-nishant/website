                    Performance is crucial for modern websites. Users expect pages to load quickly and
                    work smoothly on any device. Here are some key principles I follow when building
                    fast, responsive websites.
                </p>

                <h2>1. Start with a Solid Foundation</h2>
                <p>
                    Before adding fancy features, focus on the fundamentals:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Semantic HTML</strong> - Use the right elements for the right purposes</li>
                    <li><strong>Minimal CSS</strong> - Start with what you need, add more only when necessary</li>
                    <li><strong>Progressive Enhancement</strong> - Build a solid baseline that works everywhere</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>2. Optimize for Performance</h2>
                <p>
                    Every millisecond counts. Here's what makes the biggest difference:
                </p>

                <h3>Reduce HTTP Requests</h3>
                <p>
                    Fewer requests mean faster load times. Combine files where it makes sense, inline
                    critical CSS, and be selective about what you load.
                </p>

                <h3>Optimize Images</h3>
                <p>
                    Images are often the heaviest assets on a page. Use modern formats like WebP,
                    compress aggressively, and implement lazy loading for images below the fold.
                </p>

                <h3>Minimize JavaScript</h3>
                <p>
                    JavaScript can block rendering and slow down your site. Ask yourself: do you really
                    need that library? Can you accomplish the same thing with CSS or vanilla JavaScript?
                </p>

                <h2>3. Make It Responsive</h2>
                <p>
                    Responsive design isn't just about different screen sizes—it's about creating a
                    great experience regardless of device, network speed, or user preferences.
                </p>

                <blockquote>
                    "The fastest website is one that doesn't need to load anything at all."
                </blockquote>

                <h2>4. Test on Real Devices</h2>
                <p>
                    Browser dev tools are great, but nothing beats testing on actual devices. Pay
                    attention to:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Touch target sizes (are buttons easy to tap?)</li>
                    <li>Load times on slower connections</li>
                    <li>Readability at different sizes</li>
                    <li>Accessibility with screen readers</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
                <p>
                    Building fast, responsive websites comes down to respecting your users' time and
                    bandwidth. Every optimization you make is a better experience for someone on a
                    slow connection or an older device.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Start with less, add only what's necessary, and always measure the impact of your
                    changes. Your users will thank you.
